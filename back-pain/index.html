A poor sleep position can create a vicious cycle of back pain and sleep problems that contribute to each other. It can be difficult to sleep well if your back hurts. And sometimes your back hurts more because you're not sleeping well. Most people move to different positions in their sleep, but the majority of us have a favorite way to fall asleep.</p>
